  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 23 November 2025</p>

  <p>Spend Buddy is a personal finance and budgeting app designed to help you track your money while keeping your data private. This privacy policy explains how the app handles your information.</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>Spend Buddy is designed to work <strong>offline</strong>. All financial data you enter into the app is stored locally on your device. The app does not require an account, does not connect directly to your bank, and does not send your financial data to any remote server controlled by the developer.</p>

  <h2>2. Data stored on your device</h2>
  <p>The developer of Spend Buddy does <strong>not</strong> collect or have access to your personal financial information. Any of the following data, if you choose to enter it, is stored only on your device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transactions (income and expenses)</li>
    <li>Account names and balances</li>
    <li>Categories, tags, and notes</li>
    <li>Bills and recurring payments</li>
    <li>Savings goals and related settings</li>
    <li>Notification and alert preferences</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is used solely by the app on your device to provide budgeting and tracking features.</p>

  <h2>3. Data collection and sharing</h2>
  <p>Spend Buddy does not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collect your financial data on external servers</li>
    <li>Share your data with third parties</li>
    <li>Use third-party advertising SDKs</li>
    <li>Include analytics or tracking SDKs that profile users</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your data remains under your control on your device.</p>

  <h2>4. Backups and exports</h2>
  <p>Spend Buddy may include features that allow you to export or back up your data (for example, to a file stored on your device or in a location you select). When you use these features, the exported data is handled entirely by you. You are responsible for storing, securing, and deleting those exported files as needed.</p>

  <h2>5. Internet access and external links</h2>
  <p>Spend Buddy is primarily an offline app. Limited internet access may be used for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Opening an external support page or donation page (such as “Buy Me a Coffee”) in your browser when you choose to tap that link.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No personal financial data is transmitted to the developer when you open these external links; they are standard web pages that you visit separately in your browser.</p>

  <h2>6. Notifications</h2>
  <p>If you enable notifications, Spend Buddy uses your device’s notification system to remind you about things like low balances, upcoming bills, savings goals and backups. These notifications are generated locally on your device based on the data you have entered. Notification content is not sent to the developer or to third parties.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>Spend Buddy is intended for general use by adults and is not specifically directed at children. The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children on external servers.</p>

  <h2>8. Your choices and control</h2>
  <p>You can control your data in the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete data from within the app (where supported) or uninstall the app to remove data stored on your device.</li>
    <li>Manage or revoke notification permissions using your device settings.</li>
    <li>Manage any exported backup files that you have created.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time, for example to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Any changes will be reflected in the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. You should review this policy periodically to stay informed about how the app handles your data.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or about Spend Buddy, you can contact the developer at:</p>

  <footer>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This policy describes how the Spend Buddy app itself handles data. If you choose to use any external services or links (such as donation platforms or cloud storage providers for backups), their own privacy policies will apply in addition to this one.</p>
