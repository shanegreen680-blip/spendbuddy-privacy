  <h1>Privacy Policy – Spend Buddy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [DATE]</p>

  <p>Spend Buddy is a personal finance and budgeting app. This privacy policy explains how the app handles your data.</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>Spend Buddy is designed to work <strong>offline</strong>. All financial data you enter into the app is stored locally on your device. The app does not require an account, does not connect to your bank, and does not send your financial data to any external server controlled by the developer.</p>

  <h2>2. Data we collect</h2>
  <p>The developer of Spend Buddy does <strong>not</strong> collect or have access to your personal financial information.</p>

  <p>All of the following information, if you choose to enter it, is stored <strong>only on your device</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transactions (income and expenses)</li>
    <li>Account names and balances</li>
    <li>Categories, notes and descriptions</li>
    <li>Bills and recurring payments</li>
    <li>Savings goals and related settings</li>
    <li>Notification and alert preferences</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This information is used solely by the app on your device to provide budgeting and tracking features.</p>

  <h2>3. Data sharing</h2>
  <p>Spend Buddy does not share your personal or financial data with the developer, third parties, advertisers or analytics providers.</p>
  <p>The app does not include third-party SDKs for advertising, analytics or tracking.</p>

  <h2>4. Backups and exports</h2>
  <p>Spend Buddy may include features that allow you to export or back up your data (for example, to a file on your device or another storage location that you choose). When you use these features, you are responsible for storing and protecting those exported files.</p>

  <h2>5. Internet access</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Opening an external support or “Buy Me a Coffee” page in your browser, if you tap on that link.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No financial data is transmitted when you open these links; they are standard web pages you visit in your browser.</p>

  <h2>6. Notifications</h2>
  <p>If you enable notifications, Spend Buddy uses your device’s notification system to remind you about things like low balances, upcoming bills, savings goals and backups. These notifications are generated locally on your device based on the data you have entered. No notification content is sent to the developer or to third parties.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>Spend Buddy is not designed for children under 13. The app does not knowingly collect, transmit or store any personal data relating to children on external servers.</p>
